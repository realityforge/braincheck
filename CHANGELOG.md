# Change Log

## Unreleased

## 1.10.0

* Compile-time constants work differently between the JRE, J2CL and GWT2.x environments. Adopt an
  approach that has the same effective outcome across all environments. This involves using instance
  comparisons for results returned from `System.getProperty(...)` in GWT2.x and J2CL environments and
  using normal `equals()` method in JRE. It should be noted that for this to work correctly in the J2CL
  environment, the properties still need to defined via code such as:
  `/** @define {string} */goog.define('braincheck.environment', 'production');`

## 1.9.0

* Replace usage of the `com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:jar` dependency with the
  `org.realityforge.javax.annotation:javax.annotation:jar` dependency as the former includes code that
  is incompatible with J2CL compiler.

## 1.8.0

* Remove dependency on the `org.realityforge.anodoc:anodoc:jar` artifact.
* Change the dependency on the `com.google.jsinterop:jsinterop-annotations:jar` to being transitive.
* Change the dependency on the `com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:jar` to being transitive.
* Move the `com.google.jsinterop:jsinterop-annotations:jar` dependency and the
  `com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:jar` dependency to being `compile` scope rather than `provided`
  scope as it seems to fit into the J2CL vision better.
* Remove the `test` scoped dependencies from the generated POMs. The POMs are only intended for
  consumption and do not need to contain dependency details about how the project was built.
* Remove GWT dependencies and GWT as a dependency in the POM as these dependencies are incompatible
  with J2CL and are not actually required but instead artifacts of GWT compilation process. 

## 1.7.0

* Work-around limitations of GWT2.x compiler that was failing to eliminate the type of `AssertUtil`
  even though no reference was made to code in production mode. This involved moving guard inline
  into `Guards` class. This results in a slight performance degradation in a JRE environment when
  an invariant fails. This is should be a rare occurrence and the ability to eliminate the type in
  GWT mode was considered an acceptable trade-off.

## 1.6.0

* Removed unnecessary `com.google.gwt.core.Core` inherit from the `BrainCheck.gwt.xml` GWT module.
* Remove `super-source` construct for compatibility with GWT 3.x. Reimplemented the debugger call-out
  using jsinterop and a check against a compile time constant that should only be present in GWT
  environment.

## 1.5.0

* Remove gwt classifier from artifacts.

## 1.4.0

* Mark `BrainCheckConfig.PRODUCTION_ENVIRONMENT` and use it to control whether can modify values
  using the `BrainCheckTestUtil` class.

## 1.3.0

* Issue a `debugger` javascript command when GWT compiling code and an assertion fails. Use super-sourcing to
  ensure code has no GWT dependency.
* Add rake task to automate publishing to maven central.
* Introduce `BrainCheckTestUtil.resetConfig(boolean productionMode)` utility method that resets the configuration
  to either development or production mode. Useful to simplify test setup.

## 1.2.0:

* Replace usage of `org.jetbrains:annotations:jar` dependency with `org.realityforge.anodoc:anodoc:jar`.

## 1.1.0:

* Mark `BrainCheckTestUtil` as `GwtIncompatible` so that it is not compiled by GWT.

## 1.0.0:

* ðŸŽ‰ Initial release.
